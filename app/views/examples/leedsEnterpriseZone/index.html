    <h2>Pay with direct debit, your card, or internet banking</h2>
    <p>You can choose to pay 10 monthly instalments from April to January, with nothing to pay in February or March. Or you can choose to make a single payment before the end of April. There are three ways you can pay your Council tax online.</p>
    <h3>Pay with direct debit, your card, or internet banking</h3>
    <p>The simplest and most convenient way to pay your Council Tax is by Direct Debit. You can use our online form to set up a direct debit to pay your council tax.</p>
    <p>You will have the added option of making 12 monthly payments, and you can choose your preferred payment date.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary" rel="external">Set up a direct debit</a>
    <h3>Pay with a credit or debit card</h3>
    <p>You can also pay each instalment online using your credit or debit card and our online form.</p>
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Pay with a credit or debit card</a>

    <p>If you use online banking, you can set up a payment for the due date.</p>
